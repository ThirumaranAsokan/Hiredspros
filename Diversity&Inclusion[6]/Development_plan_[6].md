# Diversity and Inclusion Tool: Integration into HiredSpros Repository

## Introduction
This document outlines the integration of the Diversity and Inclusion Tool into the existing HiredSpros repository. The tool is designed to promote unbiased hiring by providing blind application screening, diversity metrics, and AI-powered bias detection features.

## Repository Structure
The Diversity and Inclusion Tool will be added as a module within the HiredSpros repository, ensuring seamless integration with existing features.

#Enhanced Bias Detector Module

## Overview
This module detects biased or toxic language in job descriptions and suggests neutral alternatives using pre-trained AI models.

### Key Features
- *Sentiment Analysis:* Analyzes whether the tone of the job description is negative or positive.
- *Bias Detection with BERT:* Uses a pre-trained *Toxic BERT model* to detect toxic or biased language.

### Dependencies
- *transformers*: Hugging Face library for pre-trained models.
- *textblob*: For sentiment analysis.

### Usage
To run the bias detector:
```bash
python enhanced_bias.py

# Metrics Dashboard Module

## Overview
This module visualizes diversity metrics (e.g., gender distribution, ethnic representation) and uses predictive analytics to forecast future trends.

### Key Features
- *Diversity Visualization:* Displays diversity data using pie charts.
- *Predictive Analytics:* Uses *Facebook Prophet* to predict future diversity trends based on historical data.

### Dependencies
- *fbprophet*: For time series forecasting.
- *matplotlib*: For data visualization.

### Usage
To run the metrics dashboard:
```bash
python enhanced_metrics.py

### *Challenges Overcome:*

1. *NER Integration: One challenge I encountered was ensuring that the **spaCy NER model* could handle resumes with unusual formatting. I spent time refining the extraction logic to ensure that the model could correctly identify personal data even when presented in non-standard formats.

2. *Bias Detection: While integrating the **BERT model*, I had to preprocess the job descriptions to make sure the text was clean and properly tokenized. This required some fine-tuning to ensure that the model could detect subtle bias in the descriptions.

3. *Predictive Analytics: Integrating **Prophet* required me to carefully align the historical data with the forecasting model. There were challenges related to setting the correct time intervals, but after a few adjustments, the model became accurate and reliable for predicting future diversity trends.

Future Enhancements
AI-enhanced Feedback Loop: Continuously improve bias detection based on user feedback.
Integration with Job Boards: Automatically check job postings for bias before they are published.
Real-Time Analytics: Implement live diversity tracking and alerts when diversity goals are not being met.
